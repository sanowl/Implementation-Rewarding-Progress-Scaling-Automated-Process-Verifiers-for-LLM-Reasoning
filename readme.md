# Implementation: "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning"

## Overview

This code represents an implementation attempt of the key ideas presented in the paper "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning" by Setlur et al. (2024). The goal is to recreate the Process Advantage Verifier (PAV) concept and explore its potential for improving reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs).

## Disclaimer

This implementation is based on an interpretation of the paper and may differ from the original authors' exact methodology. It attempts to capture the core concepts, but some details may vary due to interpretation or practical constraints.

## Key Concepts from the Paper

1. **Process Advantage Verifiers (PAVs)**: The central idea is to provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs).

2. **Effective Reward**: Combining process rewards with outcome rewards to guide the learning process. The paper suggests using:

   $$R_{\text{effective}} = Q_\pi(s, a) + \alpha A_\mu(s, a)$$

   where $$Q_\pi$$ is the Q-value under the base policy $$\pi$$, $$A_\mu$$ is the advantage under a prover policy $$\mu$$, and $$\alpha$$ is a weighting factor.

3. **Complementary Prover Policies**: The paper emphasizes the importance of using prover policies that are complementary to the base policy, potentially even weaker than the base policy.

4. **Beam Search**: Using PAVs for more efficient test-time search compared to traditional ORMs.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Policy and Q-Networks

The policy network $$\pi_\theta(a|s)$$ and Q-network $$Q(s, a)$$ are implemented as neural networks:

$$\pi_\theta(a|s) = \text{softmax}(f_\theta(s))$$
$$Q(s, a) = g_\phi(s, a)$$

where $$f_\theta$$ and $$g_\phi$$ are multi-layer perceptrons.

### 2. Process Advantage Verifier (PAV)

The PAV implementation attempts to compute the effective reward as suggested in the paper:

$$R_{\text{effective}}(s, a) = Q_\pi(s, a) + \alpha A_\mu(s, a)$$

Multiple prover policies are used to estimate $$A_\mu(s, a)$$, aiming to capture the paper's idea of complementary provers.

### 3. Policy Gradient Update

A policy gradient approach is used for updating the base policy:

$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} [\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) R_{\text{effective}}(s, a)]$$

### 4. Beam Search

Beam search is implemented for test-time inference, maintaining the top-k partial solutions at each step:

$$\text{beam}_t = \text{top-k}_{a} \{(s, a, R_{\text{effective}}(s, a)) | s \in \text{beam}_{t-1}\}$$

## Key Components

1. `PolicyNetwork`: Implements the policy $$\pi_\theta$$.
2. `QNetwork`: Implements the Q-function estimation.
3. `PAV`: Main class that combines policy, Q-network, and prover policies.
4. `compute_advantage`: Calculates the advantage using multiple prover policies.
5. `compute_effective_reward`: Combines Q-values and advantages.
6. `train_step`: Performs a single training step using policy gradients.
7. `beam_search`: Implements beam search for inference.
8. `train_rl`: Main training loop for reinforcement learning.

## Implementation Details

1. The implementation uses a fixed number of prover policies.
2. The neural network architectures are based on multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU activations.
3. A simplified curriculum learning approach is implemented, which may not fully capture the nuances described in the paper.
4. The advantage computation uses an average over multiple prover policies to estimate $$A_\mu$$.
5. The effective reward calculation includes a dynamic $$\alpha$$ based on the current progress of the reasoning process.
6. Entropy regularization is included in the policy loss to encourage exploration.

## Mathematical Formulations

1. **Advantage Computation**:
   $$A_\mu(s, a) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (Q_{\mu_i}(s, a) - V_{\mu_i}(s))$$
   where $$N$$ is the number of prover policies.

2. **Effective Reward**:
   $$R_{\text{effective}}(s, a) = Q_\pi(s, a) + \sigma(\text{progress}) \cdot A_\mu(s, a)$$
   where $$\sigma$$ is the sigmoid function and progress is a measure of the current reasoning step.

3. **Policy Loss**:
   $$L_{\text{policy}} = -\mathbb{E}[\log \pi_\theta(a|s)R_{\text{effective}}(s, a) + \beta H(\pi_\theta)]$$
   where $$H(\pi_\theta)$$ is the entropy of the policy and $$\beta$$ is a small constant.

## Conclusion

This implementation attempts to capture the key ideas from "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning". While it may not be an exact replication, it provides a foundation for exploring the concepts of Process Advantage Verifiers and their potential for improving reasoning in LLMs. Further refinement and comparison with the original paper may be necessary to fully realize the potential of this approach.


## Missing Add-ons

### 1. **Dynamic Prover Updates**

To maintain complementarity between the base policy \( \pi_t \) and the prover policies \( \mu_t \), it is essential to update the prover policies dynamically during training. The objective is to ensure that prover policies provide diverse and constructive feedback without overshadowing the base policy.

**Revised Formulation:**

Let \( \rho(s) \) denote the state distribution. The update rule for the prover policy \( \mu_{t+1} \) at training iteration \( t+1 \) is defined as:

$$
\mu_{t+1} = \arg\max_{\mu} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \left[ \mathbb{V}_{a \sim \pi_t(a|s)} \left[ A_{\mu}(s, a) \right] \right] - \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(\mu(a|s) \| \pi_t(a|s)) \right]
$$

**Where:**

- \( \mathbb{V}_{a \sim \pi_t(a|s)} \left[ A_{\mu}(s, a) \right] \) represents the variance of the advantage function under the base policy \( \pi_t \), encouraging diversity in the prover's assessments.
- \( \text{KL}(\mu(a|s) \| \pi_t(a|s)) \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence measuring the similarity between the prover policy \( \mu \) and the base policy \( \pi_t \).
- \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter that balances the trade-off between maximizing variance (diversity) and minimizing similarity (ensuring complementarity).

**Explanation:**

- **Maximizing Variance:** Encourages the prover policy to explore different actions that the base policy might not prioritize, fostering diverse feedback.
- **Minimizing Similarity:** Ensures that the prover policy does not become too similar to the base policy, maintaining its role as a complementary verifier.

### 2. **Optimal Prover Design**

Formulating the prover design as a two-player game allows simultaneous optimization of the base policy \( \pi \) and the prover policy \( \mu \). This adversarial setup ensures that the prover continuously challenges the base policy, promoting robust reasoning capabilities.

**Revised Formulation:**

$$
\min_{\pi} \max_{\mu} \mathcal{L}(\pi, \mu) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \left[ V_{\pi}(s) \right] + \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \left[ \mathbb{V}_{a \sim \pi(a|s)} \left[ A_{\mu}(s, a) \right] - \beta \cdot \left( \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi(a|s)} \left[ A_{\mu}(s, a) A_{\pi}(s, a) \right] \right)^2 \right]
$$

**Where:**

- \( V_{\pi}(s) \) is the value function under the base policy \( \pi \).
- \( A_{\mu}(s, a) \) is the advantage function under the prover policy \( \mu \).
- \( A_{\pi}(s, a) \) is the advantage function under the base policy \( \pi \).
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are hyperparameters that balance the contributions of variance and covariance terms.

**Explanation:**

- **Objective for \( \mu \):** The prover \( \mu \) aims to maximize the variance of its advantage estimates while minimizing the squared covariance with the base policy's advantages. This encourages \( \mu \) to provide diverse and complementary feedback.
  
- **Objective for \( \pi \):** The base policy \( \pi \) seeks to minimize the loss function, which includes maximizing its own value function and accounting for the prover's feedback.
  
- **Squared Covariance Term:** Squaring the expectation ensures differentiability and penalizes significant misalignments between \( A_{\mu} \) and \( A_{\pi} \), promoting meaningful complementarity.

**Note:** The minimax optimization ensures that \( \pi \) and \( \mu \) evolve in a balanced manner, with \( \mu \) continuously challenging \( \pi \) to enhance reasoning capabilities.

---

### 3. **Rollout-Based Advantage Estimation**

Estimating the advantage function using Monte Carlo rollouts provides a more accurate and context-aware assessment of actions, leveraging the prover policies to evaluate the consequences of actions taken by the base policy.

**Revised Formulation:**

$$
\hat{A}_{\mu}(s, a) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) - V_{\pi}(s_0) \right]
$$

**Where:**

- \( N \) is the number of rollout samples.
- \( T \) is the horizon length for each rollout.
- \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
- \( R(s_t, a_t) \) is the reward received at time step \( t \).
- \( V_{\pi}(s_0) \) is the value function estimate at the initial state \( s_0 \).

**Explanation:**

- **Rollout Process:** For each rollout \( i \), starting from state \( s_0 \), an action \( a_0 \) is taken according to the base policy \( \pi \). Subsequent actions are determined by the prover policy \( \mu \), allowing the prover to influence the trajectory.
  
- **Cumulative Reward:** The sum \( \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \) represents the discounted cumulative reward for the rollout, capturing the long-term consequences of the initial action \( a_0 \).
  
- **Advantage Estimate:** Subtracting \( V_{\pi}(s_0) \) provides an estimate of the advantage of taking action \( a_0 \) in state \( s_0 \), considering the prover's influence on future actions.

**Consistency in Sampling:**

Ensure that the number of prover policies \( N \) and the horizon \( T \) are consistently defined across rollouts to avoid bias in advantage estimation.

### 4. **Theoretical Guarantees**

Establishing theoretical bounds on policy improvement provides assurance that the learning process leads to meaningful enhancements in the base policy's performance. Below is a refined formulation that articulates a lower bound on the expected improvement of the value function based on the statistical properties of the advantage functions.

**Revised Formulation:**

$$
\mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \left[ V_{\pi_{t+1}}(s) - V_{\pi_t}(s) \right] \geq \gamma \left( \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \mathbb{V}_{a \sim \pi_t(a|s)} \left[ A_{\mu}(s, a) \right] + \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_t(a|s)} \left[ A_{\mu}(s, a) A_{\pi_t}(s, a) \right] \right)
$$

**Where:**

- \( \gamma \in (0, 1) \) is the discount factor.
- \( \beta \geq 0 \) is a hyperparameter balancing the covariance term.
- \( \rho(s) \) is the state distribution under the base policy \( \pi_t \).
- \( V_{\pi}(s) \) is the value function under policy \( \pi \).
- \( A_{\mu}(s, a) \) and \( A_{\pi_t}(s, a) \) are the advantage functions under policies \( \mu \) and \( \pi_t \), respectively.

**Assumptions:**

1. **Bounded Advantage Functions:**
   - \( |A_{\mu}(s, a)| \leq A_{\text{max}} \) for all \( s, a \).
   - \( |A_{\pi_t}(s, a)| \leq A_{\text{max}} \) for all \( s, a \).

2. **Smoothness of Policies:**
   - Policies \( \pi_t \) and \( \mu \) are sufficiently smooth to allow for gradient-based optimization.

3. **Stationary State Distribution:**
   - The state distribution \( \rho(s) \) remains approximately stationary during the policy update from \( \pi_t \) to \( \pi_{t+1} \).

**Explanation:**

- **Expected Improvement:** The left-hand side \( \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} [ V_{\pi_{t+1}}(s) - V_{\pi_t}(s) ] \) quantifies the expected improvement in the value function after updating the base policy from \( \pi_t \) to \( \pi_{t+1} \).

- **Variance Term:** \( \mathbb{V}_{a \sim \pi_t(a|s)} [ A_{\mu}(s, a) ] \) captures the variability in the advantage estimates provided by the prover. Higher variance indicates that the prover is effectively distinguishing between good and bad actions, providing informative feedback for policy improvement.

- **Covariance Term:** \( \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho} \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_t(a|s)} [ A_{\mu}(s, a) A_{\pi_t}(s, a) ] \) measures the alignment between the prover's advantages and the base policy's advantages. A positive covariance implies that the prover is reinforcing the base policy's strengths, while a negative covariance would indicate areas for improvement.

- **Lower Bound:** The inequality asserts that the expected improvement in the value function is bounded below by a combination of the variance and covariance of the advantage functions, scaled by the discount factor \( \gamma \) and the hyperparameter \( \beta \).

**Implications:**

- **Positive Variance Contribution:** Encourages exploration and exploitation of diverse actions, leading to more robust policy updates.
  
- **Covariance Influence:** Balances the prover's feedback to ensure that it complements rather than contradicts the base policy, fostering coherent policy improvement.
