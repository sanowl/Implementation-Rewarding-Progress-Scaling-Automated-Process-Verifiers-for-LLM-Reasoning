# Implementation: "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning"

## Overview

This code represents an implementation attempt of the key ideas presented in the paper "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning" by Setlur et al. (2024). The goal is to recreate the Process Advantage Verifier (PAV) concept and explore its potential for improving reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs).

## Disclaimer

This implementation is based on an interpretation of the paper and may differ from the original authors' exact methodology. It attempts to capture the core concepts, but some details may vary due to interpretation or practical constraints.

## Key Concepts from the Paper

1. **Process Advantage Verifiers (PAVs)**: The central idea is to provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs).

2. **Effective Reward**: Combining process rewards with outcome rewards to guide the learning process. The paper suggests using:

   $$R_{\text{effective}} = Q_\pi(s, a) + \alpha A_\mu(s, a)$$

   where $$Q_\pi$$ is the Q-value under the base policy $$\pi$$, $$A_\mu$$ is the advantage under a prover policy $$\mu$$, and $$\alpha$$ is a weighting factor.

3. **Complementary Prover Policies**: The paper emphasizes the importance of using prover policies that are complementary to the base policy, potentially even weaker than the base policy.

4. **Beam Search**: Using PAVs for more efficient test-time search compared to traditional ORMs.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Policy and Q-Networks

The policy network $$\pi_\theta(a|s)$$ and Q-network $$Q(s, a)$$ are implemented as neural networks:

$$\pi_\theta(a|s) = \text{softmax}(f_\theta(s))$$
$$Q(s, a) = g_\phi(s, a)$$

where $$f_\theta$$ and $$g_\phi$$ are multi-layer perceptrons.

### 2. Process Advantage Verifier (PAV)

The PAV implementation attempts to compute the effective reward as suggested in the paper:

$$R_{\text{effective}}(s, a) = Q_\pi(s, a) + \alpha A_\mu(s, a)$$

Multiple prover policies are used to estimate $$A_\mu(s, a)$$, aiming to capture the paper's idea of complementary provers.

### 3. Policy Gradient Update

A policy gradient approach is used for updating the base policy:

$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} [\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) R_{\text{effective}}(s, a)]$$

### 4. Beam Search

Beam search is implemented for test-time inference, maintaining the top-k partial solutions at each step:

$$\text{beam}_t = \text{top-k}_{a} \{(s, a, R_{\text{effective}}(s, a)) | s \in \text{beam}_{t-1}\}$$

## Key Components

1. `PolicyNetwork`: Implements the policy $$\pi_\theta$$.
2. `QNetwork`: Implements the Q-function estimation.
3. `PAV`: Main class that combines policy, Q-network, and prover policies.
4. `compute_advantage`: Calculates the advantage using multiple prover policies.
5. `compute_effective_reward`: Combines Q-values and advantages.
6. `train_step`: Performs a single training step using policy gradients.
7. `beam_search`: Implements beam search for inference.
8. `train_rl`: Main training loop for reinforcement learning.

## Implementation Details

1. The implementation uses a fixed number of prover policies.
2. The neural network architectures are based on multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU activations.
3. A simplified curriculum learning approach is implemented, which may not fully capture the nuances described in the paper.
4. The advantage computation uses an average over multiple prover policies to estimate $$A_\mu$$.
5. The effective reward calculation includes a dynamic $$\alpha$$ based on the current progress of the reasoning process.
6. Entropy regularization is included in the policy loss to encourage exploration.

## Mathematical Formulations

1. **Advantage Computation**:
   $$A_\mu(s, a) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (Q_{\mu_i}(s, a) - V_{\mu_i}(s))$$
   where $$N$$ is the number of prover policies.

2. **Effective Reward**:
   $$R_{\text{effective}}(s, a) = Q_\pi(s, a) + \sigma(\text{progress}) \cdot A_\mu(s, a)$$
   where $$\sigma$$ is the sigmoid function and progress is a measure of the current reasoning step.

3. **Policy Loss**:
   $$L_{\text{policy}} = -\mathbb{E}[\log \pi_\theta(a|s)R_{\text{effective}}(s, a) + \beta H(\pi_\theta)]$$
   where $$H(\pi_\theta)$$ is the entropy of the policy and $$\beta$$ is a small constant.

## Conclusion

This implementation attempts to capture the key ideas from "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning". While it may not be an exact replication, it provides a foundation for exploring the concepts of Process Advantage Verifiers and their potential for improving reasoning in LLMs. Further refinement and comparison with the original paper may be necessary to fully realize the potential of this approach.

The reason why the LaTeX-style equations and notation you've provided aren't rendering in your message is because, unlike LaTeX or other markdown-supported environments, this current environment doesn't directly support rendering LaTeX equations natively. Instead, the text is interpreted as regular plain text.

In platforms that support LaTeX, like Jupyter Notebooks or certain Markdown-rendering platforms, you can wrap your equations using the following delimiters:
- For inline math: `$...$`
- For block math: `$$...$$` or `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}`

## Missing Add-ons

1. Dynamic Prover Updates:
   Let $$\pi_t$$ be the base policy and $$\mu_t$$ be the prover policy at training iteration $$t$$. The goal is to update $$\mu_t$$ dynamically to maintain its complementarity to $$\pi_t$$. One approach could be:

   $$\mu_{t+1} = \arg\max_{\mu} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\rho} \mathbb{V}_{a\sim\pi_t} [A_\mu(s,a)] + \lambda \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\rho, a\sim\pi_t} [A_\mu(s,a)A_{\pi_t}(s,a)] \right]$$

   where $$\lambda$$ balances between distinguishability and alignment. This optimization problem could be solved periodically during training to update the prover.

2. Optimal Prover Design:
   This can be formulated as a two-player game:

   $$\min_{\pi} \max_{\mu} \mathcal{L}(\pi, \mu) = \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\rho} [V_\pi(s)] + \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\rho} \left[ \mathbb{V}_{a\sim\pi} [A_\mu(s,a)] - \beta \cdot |\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi} [A_\mu(s,a)A_\pi(s,a)]| \right]$$

   Here, $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are hyperparameters. This formulation encourages high performance of $$\pi$$ while also promoting a complementary $$\mu$$ (high variance of $$A_\mu$$ under $$\pi$$, with some alignment).

3. Rollout-Based Advantage Estimation:
   Instead of training a PAV, $$A_\mu(s,a)$$ could be estimated directly using Monte Carlo rollouts:

   $$\hat{A}_\mu(s,a) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ R(s,a,\mu_i) - \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M R(s,\mu_j) \right]$$

   where $$R(s,a,\mu_i)$$ is the return from state $$s$$, taking action $$a$$ and then following prover $$\mu$$ for $$i$$-th rollout, and $$R(s,\mu_j)$$ is the return from state $$s$$ following $$\mu$$ for $$j$$-th rollout.

4. Theoretical Guarantees:
   Further investigation of the lower bound on policy improvement from Theorem 3.1 is needed:

   $$\mathbb{E}_{s\sim\rho} [V_{\pi_{t+1}}(s) - V_{\pi_t}(s)] \gtrsim \gamma \cdot \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\rho} \left[ \mathbb{V}_{a\sim\pi_t} [A_\mu(s,a)] + \mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_t} [A_\mu(s,a)A_{\pi_t}(s,a)] \right]$$

   Empirical validation of this bound and exploration of tighter bounds under specific conditions could be conducted. Investigation into how different prover designs affect the terms in this bound, particularly the variance term $$\mathbb{V}_{a\sim\pi_t} [A_\mu(s,a)]$$ and the alignment term $$\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_t} [A_\mu(s,a)A_{\pi_t}(s,a)]$$, would be valuable.
